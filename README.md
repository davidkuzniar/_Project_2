## Dashboard Overview Single Page Focus

This is a first pass creation of a dashboard into a **single, focused page**, designed to give job seekers the most critical market insights at their fingertips.


This page acts as your concise mission control for the data job market. It showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) like **Job Count, Skills Per Job, Median Yearly Salary, and Median Hourly Salary**. I have also included Parameters to allow you to select **Average Hourly Salary, Average Yearly Salary** to see the effect of outliers on the results.  You can also quickly see **Skill Popularity** (by job percent or count) and compare **Salaries across different Job Titles for Countries**, all designed for an efficient overview.
